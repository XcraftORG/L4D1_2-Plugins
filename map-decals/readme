-How do I add a new decal-
1.Preparation of vmt/vtf files
	*How to create a decal - Tutorial http://www.fpsbanana.com/tuts/6640
	*Valve Developer Community - Decals http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Decals
	*file names
	-Ensure noone file has space or special characters like "long dash" (â€“) or so.
		
	*file size
	-Next, it is recommended every file will not be > 5 MB. in size (to improve download speed).
	-To decrease the size, Compress .vtf to .vtf.bz2 (file archiver 7-Zip Portable)[https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable]
	
2.Preparation the list
	-Download all files(addons and materials).
	-Put them in the correct folder ("Left 4 Dead Dedicated Server\left4dead" or "Left 4 Dead 2 Dedicated Server\left4dead2" folder depending on your game).
	-Copy YOUR vtf files to the materials/decals/TS_SERVER directory, at least they should be in materials, otherwise it won't work. Edit your .vmt file with a text editor if neccesary, to change the path to the .vmt file.
    -Add the path of the decal to the main config file decal.cfg. The path has to be put relative to the materials folder, and without the file extension.
	
3.Setup server to work with downloadable content
	*ConVars in your cfg/server.cfg should be:
	-If you are l4d1
	sm_cvar sv_allowdownload "1"
	sm_cvar sv_downloadurl "http://your-content-server.com/game/left4dead/"
	-If you are l4d2
	sm_cvar sv_allowdownload "1"
	sm_cvar sv_downloadurl "http://your-content-server.com/game/left4dead2"	
	
4.Uploading files to server.
	-Upload "materials" folder to content-server
		*If you are l4d1,your-content-server.com/game/left4dead/materials/decals/TS_SERVER/ <= here is your *.vtf.bz2 files
		*If you are l4d2,your-content-server.com/game/left4dead2/materials/decals/TS_SERVER/ <= here is your *.vtf.bz2 files
	-Upload "materials" folder to basic server.
	-Upload "materials" folder to your client's game folder (for test reasons).
	
5.Start the server and test
	-Aim at a wall and use !paintdecal <decalname>
	-Now you can save all panted decals in the map with !savedecals to the config
