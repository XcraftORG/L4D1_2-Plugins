-How to play custom music-
1.Preparation of MP3 files
	*file names
	-Ensure noone file has space or special characters like "long dash" (â€“) or so.

	*sample rate
	-All MP3 files must be encoded in 44100 Hz sample rate, otherwise it may not play at all.
	-To ensure, you can download [MP3 Quality Modifier tool](https://mp3-quality-modifier.en.softonic.com/download) and re-encode all files at once.

	*file size
	-Next, it is recommended every file will not be > 5 MB. in size (to improve download speed).
	-To decrease the size, sort all your files by size, send the files > 5 MB to above tool and re-encode them in 128 (or 192) Kbit/s bitrate (select "constant" mode first).

2.Preparation the list
	-Download all files(addons and sound).
	-Put them in the correct folder ("Left 4 Dead Dedicated Server\left4dead" or "Left 4 Dead 2 Dedicated Server\left4dead2" folder depending on your game).
	-Copy YOUR MP3 files to sound/valentine folder.
	-Run (double-click) sound/valentine/create_list.bat file.
		*it will automatically create a txt file named "music_mapstart.txt" in sourcemod\data folder
		
3.Setup server to work with downloadable content
	*ConVars in your cfg/server.cfg should be:
	-If you are l4d1
	sm_cvar sv_allowdownload "1"
	sm_cvar sv_downloadurl "http://your-content-server.com/game/left4dead/"
	-If you are l4d2
	sm_cvar sv_allowdownload "1"
	sm_cvar sv_downloadurl "http://your-content-server.com/game/left4dead2"

4.Uploading files to server.
	-Upload "sound" folder to content-server
		*If you are l4d1,your-content-server.com/game/left4dead/sound/valentine/ <= here is your *.mp3 files
		*If you are l4d2,your-content-server.com/game/left4dead2/sound/valentine/ <= here is your *.mp3 files
	-Upload "sound" folder to basic server.
